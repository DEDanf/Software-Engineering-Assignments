		<h1> Visualization of Commits by Contributor to a chosen project </h1>
		<p>
			This is a visualization as part of my Software Engineering project to visualize an aspect of the Software Engineering process using
			information retrieved using the Github API. In this example I am using information regarding a repository named 'Nutricode' which was
			used by me and my programming project team last year to develop an app using NativeScript. In total there were 7 of us on the team however only 6 members ended up contributing to the project which was maintained using a Github Repository.
